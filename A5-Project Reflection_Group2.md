##### **Intro**

During our course, we worked on a series of five assignments that marked different stages of our tool's development. The initial assignments, A1 and A2, set the foundation for what we built in A3. In A3, we combined our knowledge of OpenBIM and coding to create a tool that reflected our skills at that point. This step also highlighted areas where we needed to improve the tool further. 

Following that, we had the opportunity to have our assessed in A4, where we created tutorials for our tool. We received feedback to help us understand how others viewed our work. While the feedback was positive overall, it pointed out a key issue: our code might be too complex for people who aren't familiar with coding. This made it clear that we needed to simplify our code for our target users, who might not have coding experience.

Lastly, A5 gave us a chance to look back at our entire journey from start to finish. This part of the course allowed us to reflect on our experiences with OpenBIM, capturing what we've learned and how we've grown while working with this technology, which is covered in this file. 

##### Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.

**Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended**

At the beginning at the course, both of us were beginners. Our coding experience was minimal, and our familiarity with BIM was limited to modeling. While one member had a brief introduction to IFC in a prior course, everything else was entirely new learning experience in this course. Learning how to efficiently utilize a tool for model analysis, in contrast to the initial manual approach we were taught (as in A1), was an eye-opener. It felt rewarding to apply our newfound newfound knowledge to achieve our predefined goals. Admittedly, our coding skills caues limitations, yet we successfully developed a tool that represents our intended objective.



**OpenBIM in the future**

OpenBIM holds the potential to reshape the future of construction and building practices. It's all about making teamwork smoother among everyone involved and making it easier to share models and data across different software. As future engineers, we are already being exposed to the potential of OpenBIM, and we certainly feel like we'll be using it as part of our work toolbox in the future. 

As rules and sustainability requirements change, OpenBIM will be there to help us stay on track. It's like a guide, making sure our designs are not just good but also follow all the rules. Plus, the future of OpenBIM might include cool stuff like virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Imagine how that could change how we see and manage building projects, making our decisions even better and faster.



##### The process of developing the tool.

**Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?**

In our group, one member focuses on structural engineering while the other focuses on project management. OpenBIM holds significant potential for both areas and could greatly assist in resolving certain issues later on in our thesis work. We still have over a year before we begin writing our theses, so we haven't yet settled on specific questions related to this. However, after a former student's presentation about their thesis project that involved the use of OpenBIM, we felt inspired to explore it further as we approach our thesis work.



**Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use case?**

We would have preferred a more defined and structured project layout during the course. At times, we felt lost and confused. While the freedom allowed us to explore our ideas, we often found ourselves unsure if our concept was 'sufficient' or too basic. The lack of feedback only added to our confusion. Considering our lack of prior coding skills, we would have appreciated a guided approach that led us into the use cases rather than having to define them entirely on our own.



**Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?**

Regarding the number of tools provided in the course, we find it challenging to offer a comprehensive answer due to Tim's absence during the period. It's possible that his absence affected our exposure to some tools. Additionally, in response to the previous question, the absence of a teacher also contributed to our confusion. We believe that with more consistancy of classes, our understanding of the tools and their relevance could have been clearer



##### Feedback on tutorial.

**Did the tool address the use case you identified?**

Yes, group 6 agreed that the toll addresses the main principals, and that the use case has been implemented. They also mentioned that the tool is well-defined and self-explanatory.



**Was the use case well modelled?**

Yes, the used case was well modelled. The contractor may use it as well, however,
whoever without basic knowledge of programming they may not be able to use the tool due to the level that has been used for the code and they might have trouble modifying the code in case of changing values.



**Was the project clearly scoped?**

Yes, group 6 understood the basic principles of the tool and how it is meant to perform, and the usage method has been addressed. The main objective has been achieved but in general, it’s not easy to present the script, it is something that you need prior knowledge about, but otherwise the description and the results are significantly good.



##### Future for advanced use of OpenBIM.

**Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis**

t’s possible to implement the open BIM in future thesissubject since its targets the construction managers and if the thesis is required
to budget the project material the tools that has been developed it could be implemented to accelerate the calculations.



**Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years**

Yes, with the growth of implementation of the OpenBIM, one
could assume it’s inevitable to work in the construction industry as an
engineer and not be familiar with the OpenBIM. It’s expanding and the future potential of this tool still hasn’t been discovered fully yet.



##### Wrap up.

**Conclude your journey through A1-A5**

Overall, the he implementation of the OpenBIM has been investigated and the tool has beendeveloped to accelerate the calculation of the cost of structural elements. This tool was made to explore the potential of implementing something similar in the actual cost management in building project. 
That matter emphasizes the future potential of the OpenBIM which is overgrowing. There were limitations to the tools which is expected with the coding skills we had in the group, but overall we were able to identify the lacking elements which is also an essential part of developing a well-working and sufficient tool. Thus, with future  development of this tool, the code can also be simplified so it is more user friendly and achieves its full potential.
